                <h2> JavaScript Basics </h2>
                <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variable Declearation  </li>
                    <p> A declaration of a variable is where a program says that it needs a variable. For our small programs, place declaration statements between the two braces of the  main  method.

                        The declaration gives a name and a data type for the variable. It may also ask that a particular value be placed in the variable. In a high level language (such as Java) the programmer does not need to worry about how the computer hardware actually does what was asked. If you ask for a variable of type long, you get it. If you ask for the value 123 to be placed in the variable, that is what happens. Details about bytes, bit patterns, and memory addresses are up to the Java compiler. values </p>
                    <li> Variable Assignments</li>
                    <p> Think of a variable as a name attached to a particular object. In Python, variables need not be declared or defined in advance, as is the case in many other programming languages. To create a variable, you just assign it a value and then start using it. Assignment is done with a single equals sign (=). </p>
                    <li> Data Types  </li>
                    <p> The set of types in the JavaScript language consists of primitive values and objects.

                        Primitive values (immutable datum represented directly at the lowest level of the language)
                        Boolean type,
                        Null type,
                        Undefined type,
                        Number type,
                        BigInt type,
                        String type,
                        Symbol type,
                        Objects (collections of properties)
                        </p>
                    <li> Conditionals  </li>
                    <p> Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including: “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.</p>
                    <li>Loops</li>
                    <p> Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false</p>
                    <li> Function </li>
                    <p> A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
